The file 'tvision.ide' was created with Borland C++ 4.52 under Windows 95.
Borland Turbo Assembler 4.1 and Borland PowerPack are also required.

Steps to build:

1.  Create empty folders 'objgen32', 'objgen', 'objtvw32', 'objtvd32'
    and 'objtvdos'.
2.  Load 'tvision.ide' into the Borland C++ 4.52 IDE and build targets
    'geninc32' and 'geninc'.
3.  From this directory, run 'geninc32 > tvwrit32.inc'
    and 'geninc > tvwrite.inc'. to generate .
4.  Copy 'tv.inc' from the sources dir to this location. This way the assembly
    include files are visible to Turbo Assembler.
5.  You should now be able to compile the other targets from the IDE.
